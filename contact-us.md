This site was originally developed as a quick proof of concept resulting from a request by the Deputy Ministers Committee on Technology and Transformation (DMCTT) to enable the BC Public Service to carry out the vision articulated in a digital strategy. A hallway conversation lead to an obvious synergy with in-flight  [OCIO](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/organizational-structure/ministries-organizations/central-government-agencies/office-of-the-chief-information-officer) efforts around digital design, agile transformation and DevOps capabilities. Content was developed as a collaborative effort by folks around the BC Public Service, and also by leveraging open source material from US Government 18F office and the UK Digital Service. If you are interested in getting involved, please reach out to any of the Partners listed in the Digital toolkit.
