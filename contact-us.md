This site was developed as a quick proof of concept that resulted from a request by the Deputy Ministers Committee on Technology and Transformation (DMCTT) to enable the BC Public Service to carry out the vision articulated in Citizens @ the Centre. A hallway conversation lead to an obvious synergy with in flight with [OCIO](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/organizational-structure/ministries-organizations/central-government-agencies/office-of-the-chief-information-officer) efforts around digital design, agile transformation and DevOps capabilities. Content was developed as a collaborative effort by folks around the BC Public Service, and also by leveraging open source material from US Government 18F office and the UK Digital Service.
