title: Put your user and their needs at the centre of your design
---

Once we have developed an understanding of user needs, it is our job to design simple and intuitive services that are satisfying for the public to use. User-centered design means we build services with the people who will be using them, as opposed to building services behind closed doors and hoping that they work. Doing so requires using plain language, co-designing with citizens in the real world to understand context and opportunities, and offering users the choice of channels that they prefer. It means gleaning insights that lead to rapid prototyping and iteration to try out new ideas quickly and inexpensively before committing to a full implementation.
