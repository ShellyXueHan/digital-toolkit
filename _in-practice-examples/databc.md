### Impact

At TED2009, Tim Berners Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, [asked everyone](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_berners_lee_on_the_next_web#t-233765) - governments especially - to share their data.  What Tim Berners Lee recognized, and what the BC Government is seeking to enhance through DataBC, is the idea that government data is a public asset and its value is most realized when shared  â€“ both internally to promote efficiencies, better insights and decisions, and externally to promote business development and improve citizen engagement.
