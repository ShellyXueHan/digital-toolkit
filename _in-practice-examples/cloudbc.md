Cloud computing offers many benefits including: business agility, better time to market, greater operational automation and is the underlying technology platform that enables Digital services. Organizations at all levels share common challenges when it comes to getting their services to the cloud. Recognizing this, the B.C. Council of CIOs (CCIO), which includes representatives from the B.C. Government and Broader Public Sector, created and launched CloudBC. The intent of the initiative is to help drive the successful adoption of cloud-based computing services in the B.C. public sector.

### Impact
While still in early days of emerging demand, CloudBC is tackling the challenges of cloud adoption. Participating members are sharing knowledge about how to benefit from cloud and are leveraging cross-jurisdictional collaboration in Canada. Already CloudBC has led to a better understanding of approaches to procurement and contracting for cloud platforms and has succeeded in increasing awareness and promoting the standardisation of important compliance aspects related to security and privacy. Education sessions have been well attended and have helped public sector employees across British Columbia connect with each other and with experts from industry, standards organizations, and representing global cloud platforms. 


As CloudBC transitions from implementation to government operations, the CloudBC Knowledge Centre will become more widely available and will provide a repository for member organizations to connect with each other and access and share information - all with the goal of making it simpler for the B.C. public sector to move to the cloud.
