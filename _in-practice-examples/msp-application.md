Until recently, BC Medical Services Plan applications were mailed in for processing.  That manual processing would take weeks, and regularly involved requests for more information.  Measurement of error rates on MSP applications uncovered a wonderful opportunity.   Processing time could be significantly reduced in many MSP applications if the error rates on the application forms could be brought down.  Working with citizens, an application was designed that made the application process more straightforward and helped processing.

### Impact

Reducing application form error rates from near 30% to single digits has dramatically improved MSP application processing times.  Citizens who are eligible for MSP coverage are provided that confirmation much more quickly.
