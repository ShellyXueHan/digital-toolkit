### Impact

Consumers of HectaresBC can answer questions like, "Where are the old pine forests that have more than 5 tons per hectare of biomass, within 500 meters of a road, on slopes with a gradient of 30 percent or less? What is this total biomass by forest district?” or “What is the total area covered by each Health Authority and how much of this area is within 800 meters of the coastline and has an average winter temperature below 5 Celsius?”
