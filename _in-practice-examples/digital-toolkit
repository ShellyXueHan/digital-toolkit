While delivery of digital services in jurisdictions around the world matures, several efforts have stood out.  This one draws on recognized efforts in the U.S. ([18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/),) [Australia](https://www.dta.gov.au/), and the [UK](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) for inspiration, and hopes to provide a collection of tools, practices, examples, and learnings that inspire and enable delivery of digital services to British Columbians. 


### Impact

We have a resource that describes practices proven in the context of "digital," for government service designers to follow when designing a digital service.  The Toolkit also enables contribution from anyone who wishes to do so, leveraging a tool (GitHub) and methods commonly used in these practices.
