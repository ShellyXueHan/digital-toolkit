Today, we build services in the context of uncertainty, with expectations for fast delivery. Deadlines change, needs change and our original assumptions can turn out wrong. By managing projects using agile, iterative practices we can manage changing priorities and improve the likelihood of a service meeting user needs and accelerating service delivery. We get working software into usersâ€™ hands as early as possible to give the design and development team opportunities to adjust based on user feedback about the service. This requires that we work in multidisciplinary teams that communicate closely to build, operate and iterate the service. Complementing Agile, DevOps allows developers and operators to work in harmony so products and services can be updated, tested and shipped in quick succession.
