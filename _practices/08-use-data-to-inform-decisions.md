Being data-driven is about using evidence to base the decisions made in the design of the services people need. It means measuring the performance of those services to inform business decisions. It means gleaning insights into customer interactions with the service in the interest of offering personalized service experiences for each individual user, at the right time, and through the service channel of their choice. To do all of this, we build data measurement into every aspect of service design and delivery. Digital services can easily generate these types of analytics, offering insights into citizen needs at a deeper levels.
