### Conflict of Interest

BC Public Service employees who comment on public social media sites in their professional capacity, or who wish to comment on work-related issues in their personal capacity, must adhere to the [BC Public Service Standards of Conduct](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/myhr/article.page?ContentID=45bf7662-adf9-8a5f-74f1-657fedd69edf).

* It is essential that employees avoid any conflicts of interest when using GitHub
* Personal use of GitHub must never be confused with professional use
    * For example, a commercial opportunity may develop related to code you are familiar with
    * Before exploring the opportunity, you must discuss the potential conflict with your employer and come to an agreement on how to proceed

### Privacy and Intellectual Property

Activity on GitHub is primarily concerned with sharing or generating source code and related documentation such as specifications or descriptions related to the objectives of a project, which typically will not directly involve any information linked to individuals. However, you still need to ensure that any code or documentation you post does not contain:

* information or Records that are not accessible pursuant to the [_Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act_](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96165_00);
* sample data that includes personally identifying information;
* third-party rights the government is not authorized to license;
* information subject to other intellectual property rights, including patents, trade-marks and official marks, and design rights

The [Copyright Act (Canada)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/Index.html) applies to government employees in the same manner that it applies to private citizens. Unauthorized use of copyrighted material – including any unauthorized licensing of copyrighted materials owned by third parties – is an infringement of the intellectual property rights of the rights holder.
