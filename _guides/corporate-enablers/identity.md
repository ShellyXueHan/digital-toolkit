**BCeID Authentication Service** Owner: Sophia Howse, Service BC, Provincial IDIM Program, Ministry of Citizens' Services 

Description:  Individuals or users representing businesses and organizations can access online government services using their BCeID and password. Privacy and security legislation and best practices require the BCeID Program to protect the privacy and security of data when using online government services. The different types of BCeID accounts balance the need to provide ease of access with appropriate privacy and security protection.


Personal BCeID is typically used by individuals to access services, such as Revenue Services of British Columbia, in a personal capacity. Business BCeID is typically used by one or more individuals representing a business or organization to access business-related services, such as Mineral Titles Online.


These two types of BCeID have different privacy, security and data sharing characteristics. For example, business contact information is legally considered public information, while personal contact information is not.


The BCeID Program allows businesses to have more than one Business BCeID account, each with a set of defined privileges, known as a role. Each role represents an increasing level of responsibility or authority. These roles allow you to effectively manage your business’s BCeID Profile and all of the Business BCeID accounts held by your business. The roles are: 


- Business User - has basic privileges such as accessing Online Services 
- Business Accounts Manager - has additional privileges to manage accounts on behalf of the business 
- Business Profile Manager - has yet more privileges, with the authority to update business profile information and re-structure the business

Capabilities: Citizen Identity Management.  Business Identity Management.  Web Access Management.
