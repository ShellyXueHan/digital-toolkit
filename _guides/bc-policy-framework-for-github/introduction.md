title: BC Policy Framework for GitHub
guide: BC Policy Framework for GitHub
---

The BCGov GitHub Organization represents an ongoing effort to enable public & private sector, as well as citizen developers, the ability to collaborate on, leverage and integrate technology assets outside of the typical government procurement/contract model.

### BC Developers' Policy and Guideline Documents

_All the information a BC government employee could ever want about GitHub._

This repo's content is focused on providing information, examples and guidelines to facilitate the creation and governance of BCGov Open Source projects. We don't want to duplicate the good work GitHub has done with their own [online guides](https://guides.github.com/). Our focus is giving BC Government people and projects the info they need to get started on GitHub while remaining compliant with BC standards and policies.

### How The Information Is Organized

This guide is organized into two main sections:

* [Employee Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/bc-policy-framework-for-github/employee-guide/index/)
* [How To Info]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/bc-policy-framework-for-github/how-to-info/index/)

### Project Status

November 2015: The delivery phase of the project was given sign off from the BC Government Chief Information Officer on the Employee Guide contents of this repository. We are starting the process of operationalizing our Org activities here on GitHub.

Right now we are helping some early adopter projects get existing code up on GitHub. If are asking yourself "_I wonder if my project code could be added to GitHub?_" there is a great resource on OSS-Watch that walks you through an [openness rating checklist](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/apps/openness/)

If you are starting a brand new project - you came to the right place! This repo will get you going in the right direction.
