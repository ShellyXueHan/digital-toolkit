title: THE EBA APPROACH - Enterprise Enablement
guide: Enterprise Business Architecture

Once the alignment process is complete, the results may indicate that the alignment of the initiative to the enterprise strategic, business, and technology decisions of government is not clear. Lack of this alignment makes it very difficult for service owners to ensure that the services enabled by their initiatives are in concert with needs and expectations of citizens and that investments in technology will solve their immediate business problem and provide enterprise benefits.

The EBA Enablement process ensures that stakeholders have the tools, standards, support, and training to guide them on their EBA journey. The initial focus of the development of EBA is on the Business Definition View. The Business Definition View includes information about:

* Targeted stakeholders and their needs
* Outcomes and measures that align to stakeholders’ needs
* Key business events that drive service demand
* Core business products, services and activities
* Knowledge and information subject areas
* Service delivery locations
* High-level technical capabilities required to support the business activities, manage knowledge and information, and measure performance

Having a complete definition of the business allows service owners to demonstrate traceability and alignment to outcomes and the enterprise strategic, business, and technology decisions of government.

Definition of the business that is consistent and repeatable across government enables an accurate determination as to which corporate enablers have the biggest requirement across government and which ones deliver the most value. In addition, EBA can not only enhance whatever approach you’re using - Agile, LEAN, service design, etc. – having a definition of your business provides substantial value when applying them.

To enable an incremental, iterative approach to the creation of your EBA, the enablement process leverages the Agile approach. This is accomplished by identifying each of the EBA components needed for the Business Definition View as Epics. Each Epic has a series of User Stories. For example:

* _"I want to identify my targeted stakeholders’ needs so that I can ensure that outcomes associated with my initiative are aligned and traceable to the needs of my stakeholders"_
* _"I want to be use empirical evidence to defend my decisions regarding the prioritization of investments in service improvements and technology so I have certainty my decisions align with government goals and leverage government’s technology investments"_
* _"I want to understand the capabilities of government’s corporate enablers and how they support my initiative, so that I can use them to reduce to cost of my solution, expedite it’s time to delivery, and bring consistency to the final product or service"_

A product backlog of key components / deliverables that realize the objectives defined in the user stories is identified and prioritized. Working with your select team of business and IT staff, a series of sprints is established and executed.
