### THE ALIGNMENT WORKSHOP

The Alignment Process consists of two engagements. First is the Alignment workshop where architects from the OICO work with a small team related to an initiative and walk through the Alignment Guide which is a series of questions to help both parties understand where current alignment is strong and where there might be opportunities to improve. It is designed to be quick, light-weight, and produce immediate feedback for the stakeholder. The characteristics of the Alignment Workshop are:

**Time Commitment:** 2 hours

**Team Commitment:** 2-3 key members of the initiative

**Artifact:** The Alignment Guide

**Stakeholder Value:**

* Clear understanding of enterprise alignment direction and objectives
* Information on enterprise investments and enablers available to them

### THE ALIGNMENT ASSESSMENT

Second is the Alignment Assessment engagement which is an informational follow-up to the workshop. An Alignment Guide Report will be presented to the stakeholders which will be a chance to validate the topics raised at the workshop and discuss opportunities and next steps. The characteristics of the Alignment Assessment are:

**Time Commitment:** 1 hour

**Team Commitment:** 2-3 key members of the initiative plus project leadership team

**Artifact:** The Alignment Guide Report

**Stakeholder Value:**

* _Current state assessment of alignment and opportunities_
* _Guidance on how to leverage enterprise investments and enablers_
* _Content to support other activities such as funding requests_
