title: Steamlining Service Creation and Delivery
guide: Enterprise Business Architecture
---

Service owners across the BC public sector are being asked to find new ways to increase the effectiveness of their limited resources. To assist with this mandate, there have been investments made in a set of common business solutions and services or “corporate enablers”. Corporate enablers are enterprise level programs, policies, processes, and technologies that bring consistency to the way government plans, builds, and runs a service. The value of corporate enablers to digital government is threefold. First, government will be better able to respond on the modern service needs of citizens through the availability of standardized enterprise services. Second, they will reduce the risk to government as common services bring repeatability, standardization, and reduced cost to the delivery of services. Third, they enhance the citizen experience by bringing consistency to government services which means British Columbians will come to know what to expect when interacting with government.

 “A corporate enabler is a service, a technology or an information system which provides a function used across many Ministries and simplifies the way in which services are delivered or consumed.”

### FINANCIAL

A common set of programs that manage both revenue and expenses for government and payments to and from citizens and businesses.

* Corporate Financial System (CFS)
* PayBC

### COMMUNICATION

Networking infrastructure that enables the adoption of online communication primarily run via Internet technologies including Next Generation Voice and Instant Messaging services.

* Network BC

### IDENTITY

Secure, convenient access to government services via trusted identity information management to answer the questions: “Who you are?”, “How do I know it is you?” and “What are you allowed to access”.

* BC Services Card Authentication Service
* BCeID Authentication Service
* IDIR Authentication Service

### CITIZEN & BUSINESS

Government places a high standard on ensuring that the public has a quality and consistent user experience and has targeted investments to continuously improve its ability to provide the right information through the right channel preferred by both citizens and businesses.

* Contact Centre
* FrontCounter BC
* BC Stats
* BC OnLine
* BC Registries

### CLOUD & HOSTING

Technologies and service provider partners that provide business solutions in the cloud which serves to minimize government’s technology investment footprint and to expedite the creation and delivery of government services.

* Data Centre Co-Location Services
* Managed Hosting Services
* CloudBC

### DEVICE & PRODUCTIVITY

Finding the balance between employees having the right tools and applications to do their job and managing the technical diversity and cost to government. This means giving employees flexibility and choice for their technology while maintaining high degrees of privacy, security and compliance.

* Collaboration Software
* Unified Device Management (MDAS)

### DATA & INFORMATION

Greater access to public sector information assists in the analysis and reuse of data to meet specific needs and objectives thereby increasing engagement, transparency and accountability while advancing information sharing and the protection of privacy.

* GeoBC
* Data BC
* Centre for Data Innovation

### HUMAN RESOURCES

Maintaining government’s key resource (the knowledge and competency of its employees) is critical to the development and successful execution of business needs and goals.

* Recruitment Management System
* CHIPS (Corporate Human Resource Information and Payroll System)
* The Learning Centre
* Time Leave and Management (TLAM)

### Emerging Enablers

Emerging enablers are recent and ongoing advancements in business and technology that have been identified on the OCIO’s service roadmap or are viewed as areas warranting further investigation to determine their suitability for government investment. An example of an emerging enabler is Smart Public Infrastructure which is the foundation of the sensor technology used by the Ministry of Transport to maintain the province’s highway and road system.


Enabler | What it is... | Impact
---------|----------|---------
Distributed Ledgers | Often referred to as ‘block chain’ is a highly secure, non- refutable distributed chain of added and altered content entries into a database-like structure that allows digital information to be replicated, shared, and synchronized across multiple geographic sites. | Allows organizations to securely share information across jurisdictions with a reduction in the number of human touch points between organizations. The technology is infinitely scalable and has the ability to detect unauthorized changes to information.
Citizen Engagement and Analytics | Citizen expectations are increasingly shifting from delivering public services more efficiently to creating public value that has the power to positively impact people’s lives. Understanding citizen generated data (i.e., web site visits, call centre interactions, sensor based traffic) along with perception data (i.e., social media comments) requires the use of analytics platforms. | Citizen generated data provides government with the opportunity to improve service delivery by analyzing and automating business generated data in a timely manner. For government, analytics allows for better interpretation of how to best invest limited resources where demand or shared value can be best identified.
3D printing | 3D printing is increasingly finding its way into a wide array of modern manufacturing environments where replica generation enables quicker analysis of real world scenarios such as surgery preparation or replacement part generation in remote locations for critical infrastructure. | By enabling replica part generation via 3D technologies it is becoming possible to perform a diverse suite of tasks (i.e., surgery, infrastructure repair) in reduced time and with more predictable outcomes
Smart Public Infrastructure | Smart sensors, 'Internet of Things (IoT)', are being increasingly integrated into all forms of public infrastructure from bridges to roads to new buildings. Aging public infrastructure and changing environmental conditions result in the need for timely reactive public services when and as needed by First Responders. | "These ‘smart’ enabled structures are providing increasing amounts of real time actionable information that allows emergency managers to react more quickly and effectively. An example of smart infrastructure is the introduction of sensors into underground pipes that can detect leakage."
Deep Decision Analysis Tools | The usage of ‘bots’ (software robots) enables basic business processes to be automated. Information Analytics allowing for better interpretation of both structured and unstructured data. | Significant efficiencies in repeatable tasks can be achieved through robotics process automation (RPA) allowing knowledge workers to take on higher value activities.
Software Aided Infrastructure | Software Aided Infrastructure is the application of machine learning systems to adapt software into self-configuring systems. An example is Software Defined Networking (SDN) which provides for a more efficient approach to managing data networks in a dynamic and scalable manner. | Through the use of machine learning it is possible to create an adaptable infrastructure that will automatically scale out systems and react to high peaks of usage. SDN enhances the ability to manage network data traffic in a more dynamic and scalable manner, allowing our service providers to meet our increasing data network needs.
