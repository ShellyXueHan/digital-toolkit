title: Aligning to Government Priorities
guide: Enterprise Business Architecture
---

The _Aligning to Government Priorities_ section establishes the enterprise strategic drivers and sector priorities that form the basis for the business and technology alignment decisions later in the EBA Blueprint. The changes to this section include:

_Updates to reflect the two overarching strategies that guide all government activities_ – Province of British Columbia Strategic Plan 2015/16 – 2018/19 and Where Ideas Work-A Corporate Plan for the BC Public Service 2016. _Aligning to the goals of both of these strategies ensures that the way we transform our services supports the vision of an innovative and citizen-focussed public service._

_Highlighting the importance of sector strategies and outcomes. Alignment to enterprise decisions and maximizing the investments in digital government are best achieved when a sector works together to meet their business challenges collectively versus individually as ministries._

### Government Priorities

This layer is designed to ensure alignment with the Province of British Columbia Strategic Plan 2015/16 – 2018/19. Each of the strategy’s four pillars is accompanied by specific goals which set the course for the way we organize and execute government services. For example, under the priority Strong Economy, there is a goal of Fiscal Responsibility which means all government investments, including those in information technology, must provide maximum value to the citizens of the province.

### Where Ideas Work

This layer is designed to ensure alignment with Where Ideas Work-A Corporate Plan for the BC Public Service 2016. Like the Province of British Columbia Strategic Plan 2015/16 – 2018/19, Where Ideas Work is organized around a set of very specific goals designed to set the course for how government innovates and transforms its services. For example, under the goal Enhancing Service to Citizens, the direction is made to modernize and simplify access to expanded online services. When considering changes to the way we meet the needs of our citizens, we must align to this objective.

### Sector Strategies

This layer is designed to stress the importance of responding to government direction as a sector rather than as a set of individual initiatives. Sectors that are adopting this approach are seeing it pay dividends as it provides clarity around priorities, investment decisions, and common capabilities that can then be used sector wide to solve a variety of business problems.

### Sector Business Outcomes

This layer is designed to highlight the importance of using the sector approach to define both the benefits and value realization activities associated with transformation. There is greater potential for achieving benefits by constructing outcomes at the sector level because it encourages collective business and technology decisions that create value for an integrated network of solutions as opposed to measuring success through a set of individual, and often unrelated, initiatives.
