title: The Foundations of EBA
guide: Enterprise Business Architecture

The Digital Government Blueprint deliberately focusses on Enterprise Business Architecture and the relationship between the people, process, and technology required to be successful.

The relationship between people, process, and technology is at the foundation of the Blueprint. All three domains must be considered when undertaking a transformation initiative as success is dependent on how well all each is managed.

Some questions the Blueprint will help answer include:

1.  Are the people in the organization ready for the change and do they have the tools and knowledge to be successful? Organizational competencies are critical to success.
1.  Have your processes been optimized for the future state? Technology canâ€™t fix broken or inefficient processes.
1.  Does the technology meet the needs of its users and support efficient service delivery? Technology should always be the final consideration when transforming a service.
