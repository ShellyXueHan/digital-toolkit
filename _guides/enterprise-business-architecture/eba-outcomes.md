Our outcomes articulate how the Digital Government Blueprint will guide the design and delivery of government services. Tangible outcomes of leveraging the Blueprint (e.g. money saved, less time to implement, decreased risk, and reduced duplication) will be realized at the initiative level.. The outcomes expected are:

#### INCREASE UTILIZATION OF CORPORATE ENABLERS ACROSS GOVERNMENT TO MAXIMIZE INVESTMENTS

As a service owner, I want to the Blueprint to help me understand the capabilities of government's corporate enablers and how they support my initiative, so that I can use them to reduce to cost of my solution, expedite it's time to delivery, and bring consistency to the final product or service.

The Blueprint provides the guidance required by service owners to leverage the government's investment in corporate enablers as part of their initiatives. This promotes both increased adoption and higher return on investment.

#### INCREASE ABILITY TO DEMONSTRATE THE ACHIEVEMENT OF DEFINED OUTCOMES

As a service owner, I want the Blueprint and EBA Approach to provide me with a benefits realization framework for measuring and monitoring the performance of my service against its defined outcomes, so that I can continually evaluate its operations, identify opportunities to realign services / products based on changing stakeholder needs, and provide empirical feedback to my executive on successes and challenges.

The EBA Approach can provide an end-to-end framework for measuring the performance of a service against stated outcomes from the strategic, business, and operational perspectives. By creating a holistic benefits realization framework, service owners are able to quickly realign their services/products to the changing needs of their stakeholders.

#### INCREASE ABILITY TO DEMONSTRATE THE ALIGNMENT BETWEEN THE ENTERPRISE STRATEGIC, BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY DECISIONS MADE BY GOVERNMENT AND THE SERVICES CREATED AND MANAGED AT THE SECTOR-MINISTRY LEVEL

As a service owner, I want the Blueprint to provide clear direction on the design of digital services that align with government strategy, business and the technology I should invest in to enable these services, so that I know my initiative aligns with government priorities while minimizing technical diversity and complexity.

The Blueprint provides a clear set of decisions that services owners and leaders can use to assess the alignment of their initiatives against the government's stated business and technology direction. These guidelines form the basis of an evaluation framework from which to increase an initiative's business and technology alignment.

#### INCREASE AWARENESS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CITIZENS, GOVERNMENT, AND TECHNOLOGY WHEN DESIGNING SERVICES

As a service owner, I want the Blueprint to provide insight into the relationship between citizen, government, and technology and the impact to all three on the decisions I make, so that when I design a service the citizen receives an exemplary experience, government achieves maximum value for its investment, and the technology deployed meets user needs and supports the goals of digital government. The Blueprint provides a clear depiction of the alignment between citizens' needs and expectations, goals of government and the technology that enables them.

#### INCREASE EVIDENCE-BASED DECISION MAKING ACROSS ALL PHASES OF AN INITIATIVE

As a service owner, I want to be use empirical evidence in order to defend my decisions regarding the prioritization of investments in service improvements and technology so I have certainty my decisions align with government goals and leverage government's technology investments.

The Blueprint and EBA Approach will reduce risk for service owners by giving them an endorsed government direction to follow when designing and building their solutions.
