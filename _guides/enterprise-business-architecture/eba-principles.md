When creating the Digital Government Blueprint, the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) adopted a set of principles to guide the development and execution of the EBA Approach. The principles used are:

### STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT

The Blueprint consolidates key business and technology decisions to enable service transformation activities to be planned and executed in alignment with government’s strategic intent and investment priorities.

### STAKEHOLDER VALUE

The Blueprint must be valuable to our stakeholders - this means that it becomes an important business tool that produces better investment decision making and more impactful services.

### FLEXIBLE AND ADAPTIVE

The EBA Approach is flexible and adaptive so we can quickly adjust to varying the needs of our stakeholders. The Blueprint can provide value and guidance to their initiatives regardless of where they are in the business lifecycle.

### INNOVATIVE AND CITIZEN-FOCUSSED

The Blueprint is designed to enable service owners across government to be innovative in the design of its services. It will guide the transition to digital government. The EBA’s support for innovation is critical to meeting the changing needs of our citizens and making it easier to them to consume our services online.

### RELEVANCY

The pace of change in business and technology innovation means we must regularly review the Blueprint and EBA Approach for relevancy to ensure stakeholder value is achieved.
