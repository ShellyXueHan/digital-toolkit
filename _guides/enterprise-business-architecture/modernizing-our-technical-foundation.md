title: Modernizing Our Technical Foundation
guide: Enterprise Business Architecture
---

This section is designed to set the direction for technology modernization in government.

The OCIO 5 pillars are the foundation of this section as they clearly establish the enterprise technology decisions that support the shift to digital government. It then infuses traditional domains from enterprise architecture (business, data, application, and technology ) to create a matrix which informs stakeholders on the depth of architectural capabilities they need to consider when developing a service based on each of the pillars.

For example, when a stakeholder is considering making their service available via the mobility channel, they need to consider:

* Business Architecture. Does the service require choice of access (person, call-centre, mobile, and online) beyond mobile devices?
* Data Architecture. Is the data required to execute the service integrated to support the citizen journey and not the structure of ministry operations?
* Application Architecture. Does the design of the mobile application reflect the best practices required to ensure the optimal service experience?
* Technology. Is the service designed to seamlessly run on multiple platforms making it available to the largest number of British Columbians?

The bottom layer Common Business Solutions and Services is included to highlight that, in the future, the aggregation of demand across the pillars will lead to new and innovative corporate enablers. The adoption of these technologies has begun to surface a new set of capabilities that are common across government and therefore should be considered for enterprise implementation.

Important to note is that while this layer is framed by the technology pillars, its focus remains on enabling service design and delivery. While the technology is important, the Digital Government Blueprint is designed to provide guidance on how using a particular pillar will help them meet their service outcomes. An example would be the intersection between the cloud pillar and data architecture. While cloud technology and data integration tools are important to understand when designing a service, the rational for leveraging this technology is all about the portability of citizen data when and where they need it and so they donâ€™t have to keep entering their information for each transaction.
