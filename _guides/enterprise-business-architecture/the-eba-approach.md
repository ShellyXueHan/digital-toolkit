title: EBA approach – Align and Enable
guide: Enterprise Business Architecture
---

The EBA Approach consists of two separate engagements each with a specific set of activities, artifacts, and outcomes.

The first part of the approach is about alignment and uses the Digital Government Blueprint as a framework to measure alignment against the enterprise strategic, business, and technology decisions of government. A workshop has been developed to walk stakeholders through the alignment process from which they will receive feedback and guidance to strengthen their enterprise alignment.

The second part of the approach is about enablement and helping stakeholders design new services for digital government. Defining the Business Context is focussed on creating the new future state of a service and identifying the people, process, and technology to get there.

### EBA Alignment Approach

Using documents from our stakeholders, such as business plans and concept cases, we created a prototype EBA alignment process whereby we took an initiative/project and “scored” it vis-à-vis its alignment to the various domains of the EBA. Scoring took the form of lighting up boxes on the EBA Alignment Framework itself; the more boxes that are lit up the greater the alignment.

Alignment layers include:

1.  Strategic Alignment-alignment with government’s key strategy documents and their related principles or goals
1.  Business Alignment-alignment with the government’s current business environment
1.  OCIO Alignment-alignment with the 5 pillars
1.  Architecture Alignment-alignment with the traditional Enterprise Architecture objectives and principles
1.  Common Services Alignment- alignment to evaluate an initiative’s use of corporate common services (e.g. PayBC)

At the end of this process we provided a set of recommendations where there was both strong alignment and ideas for improving the alignment score.

This process is intended to be simple and ad hoc but is an important first step in the evolution of the EBA engagment as it makes the EBA “real” to our stakeholders. Moreover, it surfaces opportunities and challenges our partners may be facing, and gives us invaluable insight into whatthey may from the rest of our EBA engagement.

#### Enterprise alignment

From the stakeholder feedback we received about the first version of the EBA, it was clear that more work was required to define what enterprise alignment meant including a standardized way to do the assessment.

##### DIGITAL GOVERNMENT BLUEPRINT FOR BC

The EBA Approach uses the Digital Government Blueprint as a framework to measure alignment against the enterprise strategic, business, and technology decisions of government. Aligning an initiative to the overarching direction of government is a critical first step to ensuring that the services provided by government are in concert with needs and expectations of citizens and that investment decisions are made to enable an array of services and outcomes which and provide value across government.

##### THE ALIGNMENT PROCESS

The Alignment Process is about having a conversation with stakeholders and providing guidance to help them be more successful with their initiatives. Strong alignment to the strategic, business, and technical decisions of government means that business areas, regardless of ministry, are working toward the same goals and outcomes, design and manage their services in a consistent and repeatable way, and make technology investments that solve their immediate business problem and provide enterprise benefits. The high-level focus of alignment is:

1.  Is there traceable alignment to the overarching strategic goals and objectives of government?
1.  Are there strategic outcomes for the project that support the success of sector objectives?
1.  Is there a clear picture of the future for this service and does it align to the people, process, and technology within the organization?
1.  Is there alignment to the technology direction set out by the OCIO 5 pillars and has there been consideration to the way it will change technology within the organization?
1.  Are there opportunities to align with the services made available via the corporate enablers?

The Enterprise Business Architecture: Digital Government Blueprint for BC, Alignment Framework - the ‘“Framework’, is a visual representation of how the EBA interacts and supports the decision-making process behind the shift to digital government. Its purpose of the placement is to give government service owners a framework which maps out the relationship between government strategy, business design, technology enablement, and corporate enablers that they can use to help navigate their digital journey.

Each section has its own purpose and objectives as outlined here:

**Aligning to Government Priorities**

This section establishes the strategic drivers that influence and inform the rest of the framework. The Province of British Columbia Strategic Plan 2015/16 – 2018/19 (layer 1) and Where Ideas Work (layer 2) set the overarching direction that digital transformation must align to. The Sector Strategies layer is about capturing the various responses to these strategies that will become the roadmap for decisions made in the subsequent layers. New to this section is the Sector Outcomes layer. This purpose of this layer is to stress the importance of collective decision making and priority setting at the sector level in order to produce outcomes that provide a broad, rather than siloed, set of benefits.

**Defining the Business Context -= Capabilities**

This section is all about setting out the phases for the EBA Approach. Its purpose it to help stakeholders succinctly describe their business needs and design the services required to meet these needs. The key is that it embeds EBA throughout the lifecycle of an initiative providing guidance every step of the way. In addition, there is a strong focus on measuring success as the Benefits Realization layer supports the creation of measurable outcomes and metrics that align with the phases of the lifecycle.

**Modernizing the Technical Foundation**

The section is where we fuse the traditional domains from enterprise architecture (TOGAF) and the technology enablers (5 pillars) with the future state service needs of our citizens. A matrix is used where the intersection of an EA domain and a pillar informs the service owner of how a technology can empower them to meet their service transformation goals. Important to note is that while this layer is framed by technology enablers, its principles remain focussed on providing guidance for service design and delivery.

**Streamlining Service Creation and Delivery**

The final section of the Blueprint is included to identify the common programs and services that are available to service owners. Common services are cross-government business enablers that provide value to both the citizen and government. For the citizen, using common services means they will come to know what to expect when interacting with government regardless of the service they need. For government, using a common service will reduce the effort required to plan, build, and run a service.

By aligning to this set of strategies, enablers, and common services, owners will have the enterprise knowledge required to make better decisions and produce better outcomes for their initiatives. We believe that the Blueprint in concert with the EBA Approach are at the centre of this alignment exercise as the business and technology context they provide are the keys to a successful digital transformation for government and the citizens of British Columbia. The following pages outline the specifics of each section in greater detail and explain how each contributes to the province’s digital journey.
