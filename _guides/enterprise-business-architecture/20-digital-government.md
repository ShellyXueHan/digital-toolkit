title: Digital Government
guide: Enterprise Business Architecture

The purpose of each section in the blueprint is outlined here:

Digital Government involves the use of digital technologies, as an integrated part of governments' modernization strategies, to create public value. Digital Government allows the distinctions between technology and the business it supports to dissolve. Technology is no longer separate from the organization's business; rather it's integrated into how government delivers programs and services.

This means that:

* The user experience takes priority, irrespective of government structures or silos
* Citizens' information is theirs, to present and use as they wish when accessing services
* Technologies, like mobile devices, cloud computing and data analytics are creating new opportunities that allow us to make better-informed decisions
* IT is no longer separate from the organization's business, rather it's integrated into how government delivers programs and services
* Our existing roles, relationships with IT partners and suppliers, culture, skills, approaches and tools are changing
* The Digital Government Blueprint plays a pivotal role in enabling digital government by:
* Setting clear direction on agreed upon enterprise strategic, business, and technology decisions
* Establishing guidance for the use of corporate enablers as part of digital services
* Allowing our stakeholders to create a complete picture of their business in the ideal-state and focus in on areas where the use of digital technologies will provide the greatest value
