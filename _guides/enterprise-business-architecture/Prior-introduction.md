Technology blueprints are a lower level abstraction of reference architectures as they go into the specifics of the technology that the government will be implementing based on the schedule from the roadmaps.

Including the image here will break this. However, it could be moved to another spot in the document (and this comment could be removed). The copy above serves as the excerpt text. )

### IMIT Roadmaps

IMIT roadmaps are plans that match the government's strategic and operational goals with a release schedule of technology solutions and services. Roadmaps are valuable because:

- They help reach a consensus about the technologies required to meet business objectives
- They provide a mechanism to help forecast technology developments, and
- They provide a framework to help plan and prioritize technology investments

### Reference Architectures

Reference architectures provide a comprehensive solution template for a technology within a specific domain, such as cloud computing. The value of reference architectures is their ability to aggregate, in a single model, the many concerns required to implement a solution, which includes business architecture, data architecture, technology architecture, security, policy and legislation, and governance. Our reference architectures will focus on the five pillars in the OCIO strategic plan.

### Technology Blueprints

The value of blueprints is their ability to provide a clear list of technologies that our partners can expect to be available when planning out their initiatives.

### Enterprise IMIT Standards

IMIT standards bring consistency, interoperability, and economies of scale to the enablement of digital services. The value of having standards is that they provide a common language and an agreed upon set of IMIT decisions designed to ensure compatibility between systems, devices, and vendors. In the government context, they also support compliance with government policies and legislation such as privacy and the protection of personal information.
