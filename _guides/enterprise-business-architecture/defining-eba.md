title: Defining EBA - Helping Government Through EBA
guide: Enterprise Business Architecture
---

As government pursues its goals to build internal capacity, improve its competitiveness, and enhance service to citizens, there is increasing pressure to ensure that the investments in business services and technology align and enable the realization of its goals. To assist service owners to make this alignment and maximize their investments. EBA is designed to do exactly that.

The EBA is designed to strengthen alignment of our service investments to the enterprise strategic, business, and technology decisions of government. The EBA provides the tools and techniques that enable service owners to create a holistic view of their “business” and map a clear path forward for successful change. In government, this “business” is the many services provided to the citizens of the province and the employees of the public service.

This is accomplished by driving traceability and alignment to strategic outcomes which ensures that:

* Targeted stakeholders’ needs drive strategic outcomes (business intent and strategy)
* Business intent and strategies drive products and services
* Products and services drive the business activities
* Business activities identify the process designs and information needs of the organization
* Information needs and process designs prescribe the solutions and applications required for management of information and automation
* Solutions and applications are supported by the appropriate technical infrastructure

**More specifically, EBA is a collection of information and a series of models and/or diagrams created to illustrate the overall design of a business from the definition, through to design and service delivery.** Essentially, it enables the creation of a complete view of the business from the business’ strategic intent and outcomes to the capabilities needed to enable and demonstrate achievement of those outcomes.

Per Oxford University research, IT Transformation projects are 20 times more likely to run out of control than other business projects and one in six IT transformation projects run out of control with average cost overruns of 200%.

This suggests that traditional approaches are not working. To avoid this, before investments are made in business and/or technology solutions, it’s imperative to begin with a clear definition of measurable outcomes that are aligned and traceable – from considering the needs of targeted stakeholders through to business and technical designs and service delivery. From this we can then create the business definition of the ideal-state which clearly demonstrates its ability to enable those results. This allows service owners to target their investment decisions in a transparent and defendable way.

In addition to the overarching benefit of enabling the achievement of BC’s goals, EBA provides value by:

* Improving information sharing within ministries and across government
* Maximizing investments
* Enabling citizens’ expectations for digital service delivery
* Reducing time and effort to re-design business services and solutions
* Ensuring evidence of compliance with regulatory and legislative requirements
* Allowing for standards to be easily adopted.
* Increasing technology re-use

These benefits are accomplished in a number meaningful, measurable ways. A business design of the ideal-state aligned and traceable to outcomes and goals:

* Makes it easier to identify common business services and/or IT solutions across government.
* Standardizes on how capability requirements are identified significantly shortening a procurement cycle. In addition, alignment of capabilities to outcomes increases transparency and ease of evaluation.
* Supports decision-making by exposing how change in one area can impact other areas.
* Enables effective Agile development by enabling scalability of Agile approaches – the creation of the integrated definition and design of the business ensures that these complex needs are clearly understood before commencing on the journey of iterative software development

EBA can be used to illustrate the overall design of a specific business area as well as the entire organization or enterprise just as architecture can be used to design a home, or even to design a whole community.

The Office of the Chief Information Officer can assist with the achievement of these benefits through the establishment of an EBA Practice. We will provide the framework, processes, tools, templates and support to BC’s ministries, branches, and programs in their EBA development efforts and realization of their outcomes and goals.
