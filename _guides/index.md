This collection of guides is a repository of practices proven in industry and across our teams. They are offered here in support of our collective pursuit of "digital." Most of our guides are open source, and you're free to use them as you wish. You'll find them in the [BCGov organization](https://github.com/bcgov) on Github.com. While this release is internal to government, our expectation is to expand the reach to include contributions from designers, anaylysts, Ux professionals, agile practitioners, developers, scientists (data and otherwise,) and other digital service teams from other jurisdictions and the private sector to benefit the citizens of British Columbia.  â€‹ By developing this material in the open, we hope to encourage expert review and contributions from members of the tech community, furthering our goal of improving how government works through increased civic engagement of tech specialists.
