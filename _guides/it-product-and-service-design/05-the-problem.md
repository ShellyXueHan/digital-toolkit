Primary business drivers for this initiative include:

- A perception of inconsistent, complex and cumbersome processes for the design and development of new IT products and services at TS
- Periodic customer dissatisfaction with the way TS carries out IT product and service design and development
- Inability to balance legitimate customer demands for our IT products and services with our true capacity to deliver
