To address current-state challenges and to move towards the desired future state, the IT Product and Service Design Initiative is iteratively developing the following components:

- A maturity model to demonstrate a progression of desirable behaviours for IT product and service design and development across TS
- A design process map that visually depicts how new products and services will be designed and developed using a range of traditional and/or multi-modal approaches
- Simple explanations of each step in the process, including inputs, outputs and checkpoints
- A governance framework to guide new behaviour and establish key roles and responsibilities
- Recommendations on how to communicate the enhanced IT Product and Service Design process and encourage sustainable adoption across TS
- Recommendations on how to automate the IT product and service design process in the future
