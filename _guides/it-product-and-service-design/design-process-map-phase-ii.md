### Early Design & Coordination

[![Early Design]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/img/Process_EarlyDesign.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/img/Process_EarlyDesign.png)

This phase begins when the business partner agrees with the documented understanding of the requirements. At this stage the team is formed, the concept is reviewed and initial Proof of Concepts (PoC) are developed. Validation of the solution is performed by the person or client who requested the service or product.

At this point in the process it is important to identify a person who will champion the delivery of the solution and manage communications across the various stakeholder groups. It is important to maintain ongoing involvement and communications with the business partner in order to ensure that the early design meets their required business objectives.

#### _Inputs:_

- Approval to start the process
- Data entered in clarity tool
- Documentation of the business requirements
- Understanding of the business objectives
- Alignment with ministry strategic plan
- Team members
- Design specifications from previous PoC iterations
- Confirmation of resource availability

#### _Outputs:_

- Early design and prototype of solution
- Decisions on the subsequent work
- Go/No Go

#### _Process:_

1. Begin to gather requirements.
1. Arrange meetings to begin an evaluation of the request.

Participants include: central coordinator/the individual who initiated the request and may include:

- Technical resources from identified Service Delivery Units (SDUs)
- Client services
- The eventual TS owner of the product or service (e.g. Service Management Branch)

The coordinator works with the requestor to:

1. Define the overall objective of the IT product/service so that there is a clear picture of the business need being met.
1. Validate alignment with overall ministry and government strategic direction.
1. Determine whether or not this is an achievable offering.

The coordinator assesses if other SDUs should be engaged to review the requirements and the objective.

**Checkpoint: Sufficient resource commitment to proceed - validate and pivot/exit**

**Re-ask the behavioural governance questions**

The team then works to develop a high-level proof of concept. This should take the form of a deliverable that allows the client to properly assess whether or not the solution will address the requirements. Examples of this are:

- Logical-level drawing/schematic
- Screen shots of a new application
- Leveraging of existing IT product or service to demonstrate partial functionality
- Creation of a new IT product with simple-base functionality

**Check point: At each iteration confirm whether or not the PoC identifies a workable solution. Validate and pivot/exit**

**Re-ask the behavioural governance questions**

Individual SDUs determine the logistical implications for:

- Capacity
- Architecture
- Security
- Availability/Continuity

Service Management Branch determines the implications for:

- Compliance to establish standards
- Service continuity requirements
- Agreements on service levels

**Checkpoint: Is this achievable under the current logistical and service management constraints**

**validate and pivot/exit**

**Re-ask the behavioural governance questions**

1. Client relations ensures that the business partner is closely engaged and attends the requirements and PoC meetings to provide direction.
1. A high-level costing model is refined, based on the understood requirements and the operational support of the service.
1. The relevant information is entered into Clarity for the purposes of tracking and reporting.
1. The process of entering the information into the Service Catalogue is initiated.

_Exit Process:_

1. Inform the sponsor of the decision and request approval to exit.
1. Capture reasons for the exit and enter into Clarity.
1. Capture the exit type (suggested categories):
  - Deferred
  - Cancelled
  - Delayed for a significant period
1. Convene a lessons learned session to capture any further material.
1. Update the Clarity records.
1. Release the team.

This phase ends when the PoC is agreed to and the business partner/sponsor chooses to move forward with formal design and development.
