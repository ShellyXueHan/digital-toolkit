This guide is a key deliverable produced under the IT Product and Service Design Initiative being executed by Technology Solutions (TS) within the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) at the Ministry of (at the time of writing) Technology, Innovation and Citizens’ Services (MTICS, now known as Ministry of Citizens' Services - CITZ.)

### Purpose

The purpose of this initiative is to enhance and build upon the previous good work already completed by TS staff in this space (for example, previous processes developed by Deloitte and TS Policy & Development). It ensures successful adoption across TS through effective change leadership, communications and engagement.

Included in this guide are:

* A maturity model to demonstrate a progression of desirable behaviours for IT product and service design and development across TS
* An IT Product and Service Design process map that visually depicts how new products and services will be designed and developed using a range of traditional and/or multi-modal approaches
* Simple explanations of each step in the process, including inputs, outputs and checkpoints
* A governance framework to guide new behaviour and establish key roles and responsibilities
* Recommendations on how to communicate the enhanced IT Product and Service Design process and encourage sustainable adoption across TS
* Recommendations on how to automate the IT product and service design process in the future

This guide will provide the means to change behaviour, leading to sustained operationalization and enhanced IT product and service design process for TS. It will also serve as a communication tool to increase awareness and adoption of the enhanced process.

### Context

Driving this initiative is the shared recognition that we need to better understand, anticipate, and manage ministry and broader public sector demand for new IT products and services. We need to align investment decisions with business value to ensure investments are made in the right products and services, and to ensure that we have the right resources to sustain an appropriate portfolio of IT projects. We must change our own product and service delivery behaviour via the adoption of an enhanced-yet-simplified IT product and service design process that crosses all TS service lines. Overall, this more integrated approach aims to create business value for our clients, while reducing complexity and delivering excellent customer service.

In addition to the need for an enhanced IT product and service process, TS requires the introduction of both behavioural governance and structural governance, in an manner that is integrated with the overall process. Governance cannot be a standalone feature – it must be embedded within the process to ensure desired behaviours are reinforced and outcomes are achieved.

We are using an agile approach wherein iterative versions of this guide will be developed during two-week sprints, allowing us to “fail fast” and turn around quick improvements at a lower total cost. Our agile approach values individuals and interactions over tools and processes, and emphasizes collaboration with our customers.

### Target Audience

Users of this guide include any TS executive or TS staff member directly or indirectly involved in the ongoing design and development of IT products and services.

Additional stakeholders include:

* Ministry and broader public service partners
* The TS Executive Leadership Team
* Client Relations staff
* Service Delivery Units staff
* Other OCIO bodies (security, finance, others)
* Project Portfolio Management
* Service Management Branch
* The general public

### Assumptions

Development of this guide was based on the following assumptions:

* Reviewers have a working knowledge of the difference between, and complementary value of, traditional waterfall, agile and hybrid approaches to IT product and service design and development
* Users are comfortable with an iterative approach to the constant improvement of its content as our understanding of the requirements evolves through frequent trial and error

The guide is a living document that will be updated regularly and informed by lessons learned along the way.
