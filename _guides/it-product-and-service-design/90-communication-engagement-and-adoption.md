Success for this initiative means:

- Our executive sponsors remained committed at all times to its execution
- Staff and stakeholders had a say in shaping the agenda of change
- Decisions were made with clarity and with confidence
- We applied lessons learned from our past experiences, and created an optimal blend of traditional waterfall with agile/scrum (i.e., multi-modal)
- Our customers believed in us, and saw meaningful improvements

The success of the journey of change for this initiative will be critically dependent upon:

- A simple, clear and practical approach to communication
- Effective leadership, authentic engagement, and timely knowledge transfer
- Reassuring MCIOs that this is really about addressing ministry needs and expectations, and working with them to anticipate, influence and meet demands for TS products and services
- A sensible progression through a maturity model, to move collaboratively and reasonably toward desired behaviours

The change management approach for this initiative is based on the Stages of Cultural Renewal model shown in Figure 9.
