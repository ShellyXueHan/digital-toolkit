title: The Maturity Model
guide: IT Product and Service Design
---

A maturity model has been developed to support the desired progression of behaviours during the adoption of the enhanced IT product and service design and development process.

The model includes four levels of progression:

1. Legacy
1. Enhanced
1. Optimized
1. Perfected

The model also encompasses eight critical considerations related to new behaviour:

1. Co-creation with partners and vendors
1. Demand management
1. Thinking, behaviour and tools
1. Governance
1. Stakeholder priorities
1. Processes and policies
1. Vendor influence
1. Value creation

Figure 1 shows a graphical depiction of the maturity model. Subsequent figures present detailed descriptions of desired behaviours and considerations at each of the four levels.
