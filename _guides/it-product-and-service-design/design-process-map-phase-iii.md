### Design & Development

This stage begins when there is agreement between the business partner and the central coordinator (on behalf of the team) that the proof of concept has captured the requirements. Approval to go forward must be given by the sponsor, and validated by the business partner.

#### _Inputs:_

* Early design and prototype of solution
* Agreement on resources for formal development
* Acceptance of the concept for further development

#### _Outputs:_

* Confirmation of project approach
* Schedule for delivery of solution
* Project deliverables that are specific to the modality
* A completed product or service that is accepted by the business partner/requestor
* Lessons learned
* Exit strategy or closure
* Information for service catalogue and Universal Configuration Management Database (UCMDb)

#### _Process:_

The design and development team is then formed to create the new product/service. The team should consist of:

* Business partner: represents the client business interests and is responsible for ensuring that the solution meets business needs.
* Technical leads: representatives from each service delivery unit that is impacted by the proposed solution
  * Designer
  * Developer
* Communicator/coordinator: responsible for communicating across the silos and for ensuring that all team members are delivering their component of the solution
* Service management representative: responsible for ensuring that the solution is supportable in operations and for ensuring that operations is providing the relevant service specifications (such as available capacity, service level management (SLM), and adherence to policies and standards)

#### Considerations for Selecting the Modality

##### Waterfall:

* Long lead times are required for the procurement of 3rd party tools, hardware, resources
* Lower availability of the business partner or requestor to actively engage in the ongoing discussions.
* The project team has a low tolerance for continual change
* Difficult to deliver a working product throughout the lifecycle of the project
* High infrastructure component
* High level of governance and reporting required throughout the project
* The requirements are clear and well understood at the outset
* The requirements are not subject to frequent changes

##### Agile:

* Business partners are willing to commit to active involvement
* The team can be structured to facilitate face-to-face interactions on a frequent basis
* There is acceptance of being able to start work without full requirements
* There is a tolerance for ongoing change through the design and development process
* Ability to deliver a working product/service at the end of each development cycle (aka sprint)
* Commitment that an early exit will be seen as a money saving choice vs a 'waste of money'

##### Hybrid:

* The business partner is actively engaged in both design and testing
* Dedicated resources for specific roles during each phase (a design team, a development team, a test team)
* The team can be structured to facilitate face-to-face interactions on a frequent basis
* Phases that can overlap: i.e. once the first design is complete and handed off to development, the next design phase iteration is started
* A partial product or service is delivered during the completion of each development cycle until the final release produces a fully functional product/service.

Once the approach to design and development is determined and work is underway, the process should follow the modality chosen. Detailed activities will be determined by the team during meetings. Regardless of modality, some common items to document and adhere to are:

* Budget
* Delivery dates
* Adherence to TS standards
* Team composition

This process is complete when the client has signed off on the product or service and the TS product owner has accepted it for operations.
