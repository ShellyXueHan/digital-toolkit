title: The Opportunity
guide: IT Product and Service Design

In the near future we will have the tools, frameworks and staff culture required to:

- Set smart strategic direction and better serve highest priority client needs
- Anticipate and shape demand for services from our customers
- Reduce complexity from the IT product and service design process
- Allocate resources effectively
- Achieve higher customer satisfaction

Our vision is that we eventually reach an ideal state wherein:

- The IT product and service design and development process at TS is clear and consistently applied, and meets the needs of TS stakeholders
- We are able to accommodate the design and development of a wide range of IT products and services, and the process can adapt to different characteristics and requirements
- A multi-modal approach to service design and development means we can quickly prioritize new IT products and services that add value and fit with our strategic priorities, blending the best of traditional waterfall (where required) with agile/scrum
- The governance structure ensures there is clear accountability for decisions and results
