### Assumptions

- The terms of reference for the TS Investment Board (TSIB) is both robust and complete: it already addresses all of the critical considerations that would otherwise go into a standalone governance model for IT product and service design and development at TS
- The governance model that has been developed for the TS Investment Working Group (TSIWG), along with those being contemplated for both the TS Portfolio Management Board (TSPMB) and the TS Architecture Review Board (TSARB) will similarly address 'like' critical considerations
- All of these existing and under-contemplation governance frameworks also adequately address business drivers, business problems and opportunities, and clarity of business purpose: each makes clear that governance is about executive accountability for results (the ends), managerial responsibility for performance (the means) and staff commitment to excellence (the enablers)
- Each specifies roles, responsibilities, accountabilities and authorities: each speaks to new behaviour, measurements of success, and operating structures, processes and mechanisms

Thus, the creation of an elaborate, standalone and redundant governance framework for IT product and service design, development and enhancement at TS is not necessary.

What is actually required to have effective governance for IT product and service design and development at TS is the introduction and use of a multi-modal play card that defines a set of simple and clear guiding principles that align with both the global ITIL standard _and_ the proven principles of agile product and service development that come to us from the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) that has been embraced by leading IT provisioners all across the globe.

### Our Multi-Modal Governance Play Card

With the guiding principles in-hand, decision-makers participating within the Investment Board, the TS Investment Working Group, the emerging TS Portfolio Management Board and the under-development TS Architecture Review Board will have the customer-focus lens they require to:

- Base their decisions related to IT product and service design and development on the needs and expectations of those who TS serves, and with whom it partners and works
- Establish evaluation criteria for proposed designs and Concept Cases − and optimally understand, anticipate and influence customer demand for new TS products and services
- Review, prioritize and approve requests for new TS products and services − ensuring that decisions on TS product and service investments align with approved strategic direction
- Leverage the blended advantages of both traditional waterfall planning _and_ agile scrum – and effectively and quickly react to unexpected, if not on occasion catastrophic events
- Apply the correct mix of resources, processes and enabling architectures to efficiently allocate scarce government funding to activities that generate greatest gain and value − and alleviate greatest pain and risk, at lowest cost and complexity, and in the shortest amount of time

### Guiding Principles

At TS, we are uncovering bold and better ways of designing, developing and enhancing our products and services for the betterment of those we serve, and with whom we partner and work.

We are doing this by embracing innovation and risk, by accepting that periodic failure is normal, and by just getting on with the continuous and iterative improvement of our efforts and investments.

Through this lens, our staff have come to value:

- People and just doing the work, over processes and tools
- Working products and services, over comprehensive documentation
- Co-creation and collaboration with customers over, contract negotiation
- Responding to necessary change and disruption, over the rote execution of a plan

When we make decisions and approve investments with respect to the design, development and enhancement of our IT products and services we constantly ask ourselves these defining questions:

**1\. Should we invest in this?**

**2\. Do we have the resources?**

**3\. Are we building it right?**

_This means never taking on the design or development of an IT product or service at TS unless we are able to do it the right way, for the right reasons, and with the right people and the right tools and processes._

**4\. Is our highest priority to satisfy customers through early and continuous delivery of value-creating products and services?**

_This means getting something workable and immediately effective into the hands of the customer as quickly as possible, and making necessary final adjustments to it after, or even during, initial delivery._

**5\. Will we, at all times, welcome changing requirements, even late in development?**

_This means being driven by what the customer actually needs and expects, and not by what the original design specifications had said._

**6\. Will we deliver iterations of our products and services frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter lifecycle?**

_This means external customer success trumps internal design perfection._

**7\. Are we co-creating products and services alongside customers?**

_This means engaging customers directly in the design process, ensuring that the features and functionality of IT products and services reflect real-world use vs. abstract interpretation of design blueprints._

**8\. Will we design, develop and enhance products and services around highly motivated staff? Will we give them the tools, the data, the funding, the architectures, the risk tolerance, the insights, and the leadership supports they require? Do we trust them to get the job done?**

_This means equipping our own people with what they actually require to excel at customer success._

**9\. Are 'working products and services' our primary measure of success?**

_This means we value customer success more than we celebrate compliance with processes._

**10\. Do we recognize that _the_ most efficient and effective method of conveying information to, and within, a development team is through face-to-face interaction?**

_This means breaking old habits: spending more time talking to people in-person than we do using devices and electronically processing words in isolation._

**11\. Will we embrace simplicity: the essential art of maximizing the least amount of work done?**

_This means being happy with what works._

**12\. Do we recognize that the very best requirements, architectures and designs emerge form self-organizing teams?**

_This means giving competent staff clarity of design purpose, minimum specifications, and the freedom to figure it all out on their own through trial and error, free of judgement and micromanagement._

**13\. Are we reflecting frequently, and at regular intervals, on how our development teams can become more effective and adjust their behaviour accordingly?**

_This means constant judgement-free reflection on what could have been done differently or better._

The wording of these questions will be further refined in subsequent product versions of this guide.
