### Who is responsible for Citizens @ the Centre?

At the time, The Deputy Ministers’ Committee on Transformation and Technology (DMCTT) was the committee responsible for setting the strategic vision and direction for how technology capabilities, infrastructure and capital investment are leveraged to support government’s strategic priorities, and citizen expectations for government services. Responsible for the development of Citizens @ the Centre, DMCTT set a vision for being a better government for the citizens of BC.  

(Note: DMCTT is now the Deputy Ministers' Committee on Public Service Innovation, DMCPSI.)

### How was Citizens @ the Centre Developed?

In 2015, groups across government connected to share stories, strategies and priorities regarding government’s future vision for service delivery, and to ensure that we continue to put Citizens @ the Centre. From across our ministries, strategic planners, senior executive, program leads, operational staff and technology experts met and observed that a shared but uncoordinated transformation is underway. Through facilitated sessions, engagement, deliberation and analysis, they reflected on their individual ministries’ directions, strategies and priorities, and discussed ways in which they can work towards shared outcomes. Further, insights on emerging digital trends were gleaned from industry experts such as Gartner, Forrester, Accenture, Deloitte, and we collaborated with our government peers at the federal, state and municipal levels around the world. This laid out the foundation for a refreshed approach to "digital."

### What happened to Citizens @ the Centre?

The concept and importance of delivering services to citizens digitally remains.  This is emphasized within the most recent corporate plan for the BC public Service, [Where Ideas Work](https://gww.gov.bc.ca/org/corp-plan/where-ideas-work), where Citizens @ the Centre remains a relevant body of work (see goal 3 in that plan) guiding us all in our delivery of services to the citizens of British columbia.
