Citizens @ the Centre was government's first technology and transformation strategy, and represented a vision for how the public service sees itself making the citizen experience better. It conveyed that the BC Government is open to working and delivering services in new ways. It intended to provide the BC Public Service with clarity on who is doing what in our efforts to deliver digital services, and to share the innovative approaches that are taking place around government so that we can connect. The accompanying toolkit is intended to offer resources and connect Public Service staff that can help to make that vision real. The stories, tools, applications, methodologies, practices, and resources presented in this toolkit show that today, "digital" is maturing within government, for the people of BC. We continue to evolve.
