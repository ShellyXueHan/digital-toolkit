title: The Big Data Deluge
guide: Data-Driven Decision Making

Data science is often spoken in the same breath as "big data". Which is also not a new thing; those gigabytes and megabytes were growing in the background until one day someone realized that we'll soon be dealing in yottabytes, and it wasn't just data anymore, it was "big data".

I think the UPC bar code is a perfect example of this shift. The UPC code was designed in the early 1970s as point-of-sale scanners were being adopted. This computerization was designed to improve business processes---instead of the clerk at the checkout punching in every price, the scanner did that work. Coupled with the increasing power and memory of computers, it also allowed stores to better track sales and inventory.

Since then there has been exponential growth in the volume of data collected as part of business process. And there have been similar expansions in how that data is used. The UPC codes have revolutionized supply chain management, and are used by stores to understand consumer behaviour. It’s not just "How many boxes of strawberry Pop Tarts are on the shelves?" or "How many boxes of strawberry Pop Tarts do we need to order?" but "What environmental conditions can be used to predict when shoppers will buy strawberry Pop Tarts?" [(Spoiler: hurricanes.)](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/14/business/yourmoney/what-walmart-knows-about-customers-habits.html)

And retailers are using information about what we buy to try to sell us more stuff---think of amazon’s "frequently bought together" and "customers who viewed this item also viewed" entires.

Another thing that has changed is that in many cases data are updated frequently, and made available to analysts on the fly. This means that there is very little lag between the data collection and the analytic output. (Think of the GPS system in your car or on your phone.)

In parallel with big data, public agencies around the world are being more transparent by releasing more and more data, and making it available in formats that can be read by any computer. This supports transparency and accountability, and also provides a public good by allowing outside entities to use publically-collected data and information in other applications.
