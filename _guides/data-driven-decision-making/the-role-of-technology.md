I just want to loop back to technology for a minute.

The people in this picture are "navvies"---the men who dug the canals that criss-cross Britain, which were an important part of the industrial revolution. The idea of canals was an old one, and the use of the steam train to move the dirt was an innovation that helped speed the construction of the [Manchester Ship Canal](http://www.victorianweb.org/history/work/sullivan/13.jpg).

But when it came to building the Panama Canal, human effort was insufficient---and the harnessing of steam power in a new way, with the steam shovel, was the technology that accelerated canal building.

The same is true with information technology---it can be used to accelerate the use of data, but it is _not_ the solution.

Simultaneous with the increased volume and variety of data that are being collected (and in some cases shared), we have more accessible technology to work with the data. This includes powerful desktop computers with lots of storage, networks and clouds to share the information, and advances in analytic tools.

(Stephen Messer, quoted in Barlow, _Learning to Love Data Science_, p.6)

### In closing:

The scientific method guides data science. Data science solves known problems with the scientific method. (Grolemund & Wickham, [_R for Data Science_](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/do-science-with-data.html), chapter 20)
