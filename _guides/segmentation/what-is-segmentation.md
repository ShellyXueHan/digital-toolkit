title: What is Segmentation?
guide: Segmentation

Segmentation is the process of identifying key groups or segments within a larger population that share specific characteristics, preferences and behaviours. Once the population is broken into segments, those conducting the segmentation analysis can use this information to better develop programs tailored for each segment. That is, they can focus services on one or two segments or niches, or develop new services to appeal to one or more of the segments. Acknowledging the typical heterogeneity of large populations, segmentation allows those developing services to avoid treating those populations with a one-size-fits-all solutions.
