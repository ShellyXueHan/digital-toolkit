The B.C. public service does not currently offer a corporate service for segmentation analyses. However, the Ministry of Technology and Citizens' Services conducted, through Environics, a PRIZM Analysis of British Columbia in 2015, the results of which can be accessed by anyone in the B.C. public service, [here](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/government/services-for-government-and-broader-public-sector/information-technology-services/standards-files/bc_mtic_-_target_segment_thumbnail_sketch-_2015_06_30.pdf).

Development of a Corporate Supply Arrangement for segmentation analyses is currently underway, the results of which will be reflected in this guide when available.
