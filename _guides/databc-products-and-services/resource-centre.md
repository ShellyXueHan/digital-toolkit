DataBC has compiled a strong collection of material to support application development and the use of data. You will find Application Delivery Standards, resources for data administration, metadata guidelines, a catalogue user guide and much more in [the DataBC Resource Centre](https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/DataBC/FAQ#government--technology-standards).  

NB: A government IDIR is required.  Some content will require a GitHub account.
