The Agility Profile establishes a holistic view of organizational, team and project related factors, creating an overall Agility Profile which provides the necessary insight to make the right decisions toward your delivery methodology and equally importantly decisions surrounding areas of the methodology that require tailoring to optimize for the specific case at hand.

In the Decision Tool below, you'll see references to "bimodal." This refers to a development methodology that combines "Mode 1" (Waterfall) and "Mode 2" (Agile) to (as Gartner puts it,) "Improve Mode 1 predictability and quality by transitioning Mode 1 work toward agile and DevOps practices."  It is a difficult practise to balance effectively, because there is always a tendency towards strong traditional oversight and governance, which can constrain agility and adaptability.
