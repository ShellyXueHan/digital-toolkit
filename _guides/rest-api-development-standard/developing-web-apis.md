title: Developing Web APIs
guide: REST API Development Standard
---

Web APIs in the BC Government (BCGov) must be designed and developed according to RESTful architecture principles as described by Roy Thomas Fielding's dissertation "[Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/fielding_dissertation.pdf)" (2000) adapted to mandated minimums for the BCGov and design choices in support of web interoperability. The intent is not to limit development to the prescribed minimums but to ensure that BCGov web APIs behave consistently and to balance a truly RESTful API interface with a positive developer experience (DX).

The [OCIO REST API Development Standard](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/government/services-for-government-and-broader-public-sector/information-technology-services/standards-files/rest_api_development_standard.pdf) document contains the mandated minimum attributes.
