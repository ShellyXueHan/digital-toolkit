This toolkit offers a set of good practices that can be followed when developing a digital service. The practices are listed below, in a "for-best-results suggested order," top-to-bottom. In this toolkit, you will find resources and guides, and stories shared by our peers who are experimenting and succeeding with these approaches today. It is open for anyone's contributions.

Content within this resource is intended to be provided and maintained by the community. You are part of that community.  There are feedback opportunities on each page.  You may also contribute content or provide updates to existing content through GitHub, where the content lives - instructions are available via the Contribute link, above.  

At launch, there remain stories to tell and resources to add, among which are STIR, service patterns, Analytics, Behavioural Insights, procurement, more on the government API Registry, more about Corporate Enablers (and "more cowbell!") If you'd seen this resource in its prototype state, you will notice a a new look, and a significant new guide, in DataBC Products & Services, among others.
