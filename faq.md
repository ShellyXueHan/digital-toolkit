### What is this?

This Toolkit sets out the ten steps a BC Public Service employee can use to design and deliver a next generation service, one that makes use of modern tools and approaches, and does so leveraging the capabilities of groups around government. It identifies and provides contact information for those groups in government with the ability and responsibility to provide the supports necessary to create such a service. And it shares information about the impact of real world BC Government next generation services in action, including how to connect with the government colleagues who have put these services into action, so we can share experiences, learning and our ability to deliver as a connected organization.

### Who can contribute to its evolution? Can I? How?

Anyone within government can contribute. The more participation and collaboration on these resources there is, the more relevant and valuable it becomes. Requirements for, and details of, the contribution process can be found in [the Contribution Wiki](https://github.com/bcgov/digital-toolkit/wiki).

### Who's it for?

It's for everyone in the BC Public Service with an interest in providing the best quality services for the people of British Columbia, using leading edge tools, technologies and methodologies to do so. In other words, it's for all of us.

### Why do we need it?

This Toolkit was build in response to an identified need around government, from all levels of the organization. It responds to the observation that while numerous groups in the BC Public Service have been working on next generation service offerings, a comprehensive how-to guide didn't exist, meaning that each next work unit seeking to design their own service often found themselves doing so in isolation, coming up with their own solutions net new. Folks weren't clear on who was doing what in government, what services were available from which parties, and how to go about following the steps necessary to design and delivery a next generation service. This Toolkit seeks to connect those dots, illuminate this work, and identify the gaps that we as an organization should be seeking to fill. Happily, the process of compiling this Toolkit has already catalyzed the process of filling those gaps and better connecting the great work going on around the BC Public Service.

### What's in it?

You'll find three layers to the toolkit:

1.  A front page describing basic steps and principles;
1.  A set of high level guides that further define those steps and principles, and;
1.  Detailed guides providing a deeper level of information and instruction with those responsible for designing and delivering simple, streamlined, modern services.

The front layer provides a navigation guide for all users, and for the user new to the components of designing and delivering next generation services, a set of introductions and definitions. For those wishing to dig deeper into each of the steps and subject areas, the second layer articulates guides for how to go about completing each of the Toolkit's steps, at a high level. Last, for those working hands-on with each of the Toolkit's steps, these individuals can get granular with the third layer's set of detailed guides and corporate service offerings. For all users, the Toolkit provides illustrations of this work in action around the BC Government, as well as connections to the colleagues leading this work in practice and deeper stories, where available (e.g. on @Work), to how this working is being conducted, and the impact it is having.

### Who built it? How?

The Toolkit was built by a cross-government team committed to connecting and bolstering the capacity of our organization. It was originally developed in 2016 as a quick proof of concept, leveraging open source material, in two agile sprints - i.e. four short weeks - to support the vision articulated in Citizens @ the Centre.  In early 2018, the Architecture, Standards & Planning branch (ASPB) of the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) leveraged the innovative [Code With Us](https://bcdevexchange.org/codewithus) procurement to secure resources to complete the build and refine content, over five one-week sprints.

### Will it answer all my questions?

Chances are, no, given this toolkit is an alpha - a prototype. In other words, it's a work in progress compiled collaboratively by folks around government passionate about enhancing our services and adding ease and impact to our work. The idea is that those same folks - with your help - will continue to build it as we go, sparking conversations, connecting in communities of practice, making it better as we do so. In the interim, if you're left with burning questions, send us a note and we'll do our best to help out or redirect your question as appropriate. Or, have a look through the examples in the Toolkit of its steps being put into practice, and connect with the project leads listed there - they've shared their contact information to share the information and expertise they've learned by doing and are happy to help out.

#### Didn't find what you need?

We recognize that not all projects are suitable for these approaches. If you have a project that is more suited to a traditional “waterfall” type of approach, please reference [the IT Product and Service Design guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/it-product-and-service-design) that shows how traditional approaches can leverage an agile methodology. And along those lines, here is a [collection of resources that helps transition towards an agile approach](https://github.com/bcgov/agile-sdlc/wiki).  Also, you're welcome to submit your own content to this collection via Github - click any of the "Contribution" links.
